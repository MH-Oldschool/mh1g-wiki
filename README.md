A web app that organizes all weapons from Monster Hunter G into groups and branches for easy reference. [Visit the active app here!](https://mhg-weapon-trees.herokuapp.com/)

#Current State
I sourced all the weapon data from [mmpotato's MHG Analysis](http://infoseek_rip.g.ribbon.to/mmpotato.hp.infoseek.co.jp/codes/MHG/). Since I don't know Japanese very well, I used a plugin to translate everything, and consulted [Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Fandom Wiki](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/MHFU:_Weapons) to correct the weapon names. Many weapon names may still be incorrect, and I'm certain a lot of the material names are wrong too. Feel free to reach out and submit any corrections, but keep the Issues tab purely for technical problems.
